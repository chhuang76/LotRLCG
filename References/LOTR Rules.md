Introduction
“You have done well to come,” said Elrond. “You will 
hear today all that you need to understand the purpose 
of the Enemy. There is naught that you can do, other 
than to resist, with hope or without it. But you do not 
stand alone. You will learn that your trouble is but part 
of the trouble of all the western world.” 
 –from the chapter “The Council of Elrond” 
  The Lord of the Rings,  
  The Fellowship of the Ring
Welcome to Middle-earth, a land of Hobbits, Elves, 
Dwarves, Wizards, and Men. From the bright towns 
and fields of the Shire, to the wilds of Mirkwood 
Forest and Rhovanion, and to the powerful kingdoms 
of Gondor and Rohan, the various peoples of this land 
struggle against the foul minions and the ancient, evil 
threat of the Dark Lord, Sauron.
Game Overview
The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a game of 
heroes, perilous journeys, and adventure set in the 
lands described in the epic fantasy masterpiece created 
by J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings. In this game, 
players take on the role of a party of heroes who 
are attempting to complete dangerous quests. These 
quests take place during a timespan of 17 years: from 
when Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday (and Frodo’s 
33rd) to days just prior to Frodo’s leaving the Shire. 
Instead of directly retelling the classic stories that have 
previously been narrated, this game provides players 
with a variety of elements—characters, settings, 
enemies, events, items, artifacts, scenarios—that allow 
them to embark upon new adventures and share new 
experiences with the beloved The Lord of the Rings 
characters and settings during this period of Middleearth history.
Unlike most card games, in which the players compete 
against each other, The Lord of the Rings: The Card 
Game is a cooperative game in which the players 
work together, competing against a scenario that is run 
automatically by the game. In each game the players 
attempt to overcome the particular encounters, enemies, 
and challenges of a scenario, against which they either 
win or lose together.
The Living Card Game
The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a one to 
two player game that can be played using only the 
contents of this core set. (Up to four players can play 
the game cooperatively with a second copy of the core 
set.) In addition, The Lord of the Rings: The Card 
Game is a Living Card Game®, and the enjoyment 
and experience of the game can be customized and 
enhanced through the purchase of regularly released 
60 card expansions called Adventure Packs. Each 
Adventure Pack provides players with new options 
and strategies for their decks (see page 27), as well 
as an entirely new scenario against which to play. 
Additionally, deluxe Quest Packs introduce new areas 
of Middle-earth in which players can journey, explore, 
and seek new adventures. The Lord of the Rings: The 
Card Game can be played both casually, with friends, 
or through the organized play program that is officially 
sanctioned by Fantasy Flight Games.

Component Overview
The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game core set 
includes the following components:
-  This	Rulebook
-  226	cards,	consisting	of:
-  12	Hero	Cards
-  120	Player	Cards
-  84	Encounter	Cards
-  10	Quest	Cards
-  2	Threat	Trackers	(each	consisting	of	1	faceplate,	2	
dials,	and	4	plastic	dial	connectors)
-  40	Damage	Tokens
-  26	Progress	Tokens
-  30	Resource	Tokens
-  1	First	Player	Token
Cards
The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game core set 
features 226 cards. Four starter decks, each built 
around a distinct sphere of influence (Leadership, Lore, 
Spirit, and Tactics), can be played right out of the box 
in the introductory game, or the cards in these decks 
can be combined together to create tournament legal 
decks. Also included in this set are 3 scenarios and 84 
encounter cards for the players to compete against. For 
a complete explanation of each card type, see  
pages 5-9.
Threat Trackers
Threat trackers are used to track a player’s threat level 
throughout the game. Threat represents the level of risk 
a player has taken on during a scenario. If a player’s 
threat level reaches a certain threshold, that player is 
eliminated from the game. A player’s threat level can 
also draw out enemy encounters and set off unfortunate 
circumstances throughout the course of the game.
To assemble a threat tracker, use the plastic dial 
connectors to attach two dials to each faceplate as 
shown in the diagram below.
Damage and 
Progress Tokens
Damage tokens represent 
physical damage that has 
been inflicted on characters 
and enemies. Progress 
tokens represent progress 
that has been made on a 
quest.
Resource Tokens
These tokens represent the 
various resources at a hero’s 
disposal. Resource tokens 
are collected by a player’s 
heroes, and are used 
throughout the game to pay 
for cards and card effects.
First Player 
Token
The first player token 
determines which player 
acts first each phase. At 
the end of each round, the 
first player token passes 
clockwise to a new player.

Gameplay Overview
In each game of The Lord of the Rings: The Card 
Game, players begin by choosing a scenario, and then 
work together in an attempt to complete it. A scenario 
is completed by successfully moving through all stages 
of the quest deck. During a scenario, the encounter 
deck aims to harm the heroes and to raise each player’s 
threat level. A player is eliminated from the game if 
all of his heroes are destroyed, or if his threat level 
reaches 50. If all players are eliminated from the game, 
the players have lost. If at least one player survives and 
completes the final stage of the quest deck, all players 
are victorious.
Spheres of Influence
There are four different spheres of influence in The 
Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, and each has its 
own distinct flavor and identity. Most player cards fall 
under one of these spheres, represented by a unique 
icon, as well as by a unique color on its card border. 
Each hero has an emphasis in one of these four spheres. 
A hero’s sphere dictates the types of cards that hero 
allows a player to use.
Leadership
The sphere of Leadership 
emphasizes the charismatic 
and inspirational influence 
of a hero, and that hero’s 
potential to lead, inspire, and 
command both allies and 
other heroes alike.
Lore
The sphere of Lore 
emphasizes the potential 
of a hero’s mind. Intellect, 
wisdom, experience, and 
specialized knowledge are 
all under the domain of  
this sphere.
Spirit
The sphere of Spirit 
emphasizes the strength of a 
hero’s will. Determination, 
resilience, courage, loyalty, 
and heart are all aspects of 
this sphere.
Tactics
The sphere of Tactics 
emphasizes a hero’s martial 
prowess, particularly as it 
relates to combat and to 
overcoming other tactical 
challenges that might 
confront the players during 
a quest.
The Golden Rule
If the game text of a card contradicts the text of this 
rulebook, the text on the card takes precedence.

Decks and Card Types
There are three different types of decks in The Lord 
of the Rings: The Card Game: the quest deck, the 
encounter deck, and the player deck. There are also 
hero cards, which do not belong to any deck. Each deck 
has its own function and its own set of card types, as 
described below. In the game, each player plays one 
player deck, and the players work together to move 
through a fixed quest deck. A randomized encounter 
deck operates in conjunction with the quest deck in 
each scenario to challenge the players as they play 
against the game.
The Quest Deck
Each scenario represents a quest that the players are 
attempting to complete. At the beginning of a game, 
the players must choose which scenario they wish to 
play against for that game. A scenario consists of a 
sequential deck of quest cards (referred to as “the quest 
deck”) and a randomized encounter deck of enemy, 
location, treachery, and objective cards. For more 
information on the scenarios in this core set, see  
page 26.
Quest Cards
Each quest card represents one of the various stages of 
the quest the players are pursuing in a scenario. Each 
quest card is a numbered step in a fixed, sequential 
order. These cards have their sequential information 
printed on both sides, so they can be placed in the 
correct order without spoiling the contents of the latter 
stages in the scenario. Side A is the back of the card, 
and provides story and setup information. After reading 
and following any instructions on Side A, players flip 
the card to Side B. Side B contains the information 
necessary to move to the next stage of the quest.
Card Anatomy Key - The Quest Deck
1. Card Title: The name of this card. Each sequential 
stage in a scenario has its own unique name.
2. Scenario Symbol: A visual icon that identifies this 
scenario, matching it to a subset of encounter cards. 
3. Sequence: This number determines the order in 
which the scenario deck is stacked at the beginning of 
the game. When setting up, card 1A is placed on top, 
followed by 2A, 3A, and so forth. Players proceed from 
side A to side B on each stage of a scenario.
4. Encounter Information: A group of icons that, 
along with the scenario symbol, identify which 
encounter cards should be shuffled into the encounter 
deck when playing this scenario.
5. Scenario Title: The name of this scenario.
6. Game Text: Story, setup instruction, special effects, 
or conditions that apply during this stage of the 
scenario.
7. Set Information: Every card has an icon denoting 
the set it belongs to, as well as a unique identification 
number within the set.
8. Quest Points: The number of progress tokens that 
must be placed on this card in order to proceed to the 
next stage of the scenario.

## Page 6

The Encounter Deck
The encounter deck represents the villains, hazards, 
places, and circumstances that stand between the 
players and the successful completion of their quest. 
An encounter deck consists of enemy, location, and 
treachery cards. The contents of the encounter deck are 
determined by the scenario the players are attempting 
(see “Scenario Overview” on page 26). The encounter 
deck is shuffled at the beginning of the game.
Card Anatomy Key - The 
Encounter Deck
1. Card Title: The name of this card.
2. Engagement Cost: This number determines when 
this enemy card will move from the staging area and 
engage a player.
3. Threat Strength ((Threat)): The degree of danger this 
enemy or location represents when it threatens the 
players from the staging area.
4. Attack Strength ((Attack)): The effectiveness of this 
enemy when it attacks.
5. Defense Strength ((Defense)): The effectiveness of this 
enemy when it defends.
6. Quest Points: The number of progress tokens that 
must be placed on this location to fully explore the 
location and discard it from play.
7. Hit Points: The amount of damage required to 
destroy this card.
8. Encounter Set Icon: Indicates which set of 
encounter cards this card belongs to. Used in 
conjunction with the “Encounter Information” icons  
on side A of the quest cards of any scenario to 
determine which encounter sets are used to build the 
encounter deck.
9. Traits: Text designators that, while carrying no rules 
in themselves, may be affected by other cards in play.
10. Game Text: The special abilities unique to this 
particular card when it is in play.
11. Shadow Effect Icon: If a card has a shadow  
effect, that effect is denoted by this icon, which also 
serves to separate the shadow effect from the card’s in 
play effect.
12. Card Type: Indicates whether this card is an 
enemy, location, treachery, or objective.
13. Set Information: Every card has an icon denoting 
the set it belongs to, as well as a unique identification 
number within the set.
14. Scenario Title: The name of the scenario to which 
this objective card belongs.
Enemy Cards
Enemy cards represent the villains, creatures, monsters, 
and minions that attempt to capture, destroy, or mislead 
the heroes as they pursue their quest. Enemy cards 
engage individual players and remain in play until they 
are defeated.
Location Cards
Location cards represent the perilous places to which 
the players may travel during a scenario. They are a 
distant threat to the players from the staging area (see 
page 10), and during the course of the quest players 
may opt to travel to a location to confront its threat.

---

## Page 7

Treachery Cards
Treachery cards represent traps, curses, maneuvers, 
pitfalls, and other surprises the players might confront 
during a scenario. When a treachery card is revealed 
from the encounter deck, its text effects are resolved 
immediately, and it is then placed in the encounter 
discard pile.
Objective Cards
Depending on the scenario, objective cards can 
represent a number of different elements, ranging from 
the goals of a scenario, to allies who assist the players, 
to keys that allow the players to advance to the next 
stage of a quest, to artifacts that are necessary to defeat 
a difficult enemy or overcome a particular challenge. 
Unless otherwise specified, objective cards are shuffled 
into the encounter deck when setting up a scenario. 

---

## Page 8

Hero Cards
Hero cards represent the main characters a player 
controls in an attempt to complete a scenario. Heroes 
start in play, and they provide the resources that are 
used to pay for the cards (allies, attachments, and 
events) in a player’s deck. Heroes can also commit to 
quests, attack, defend, and in many cases they bring 
their own card abilities to the game. Each player 
chooses 1-3 hero cards and starts the game with them 
in play. 
Unique Cards
Some cards in this game represent specific, 
formally named characters, locations, and items from 
the Middle-earth setting. These cards are referred 
to in the game as “unique.” They are marked with 
a * symbol before their card title to indicate their 
uniqueness.
If any player has a unique card in play, no player can 
play or put into play another card with the same title. 
Any attempt to do so will fail to the extent that the card 
attempting to enter play remains in its current location 
(hand, deck, discard pile) and does not enter play. This 
rule applies to all unique hero, ally, attachment, and 
event cards that might enter play. Note that a unique 
card is eligible to enter play if another card with the 
same title is in a player’s discard pile but not currently 
in play.
Multiple copies of the same non-unique card can be in 
play simultaneously. 
Card Anatomy Key - Hero Cards and 
The Player Deck
1. Card Title: The name of this card. A card with a  
*	symbol next to its name is unique. (See “Unique 
Cards,” page 8.)
2. Cost: The number of resources a player must spend 
from the appropriate resource pool(s) to play this card 
from his hand. Cost is not found on hero cards.
3. Threat Cost: Found only on hero cards, this number 
is the amount of threat a player must add to his threat 
tracker at the beginning of any game in which he is 
using this hero.
4. Sphere of Influence Icon: Indicates which sphere 
this card belongs to. The card’s template color also 
indicates this. Neutral cards have a grey template and 
no sphere of influence icon.
5. Willpower Strength ((Willpower)): The effectiveness of this 
character when it commits to a quest.
6. Attack Strength ((Attack)): The effectiveness of this 
character when it attacks.
7. Defense Strength ((Defense)): The effectiveness of this 
character when it defends.
8. Hit Points: The amount of damage required to 
destroy this card.
9. Resource Icons: Found only on hero cards, these 
icons indicate the sphere(s) of influence to which 
resource tokens in this hero’s resource pool belong. 
They also indicate to which sphere(s) the hero card 
itself belongs.
10. Traits: Text designators that, while carrying no 
rules in themselves, may be affected by other cards in 
play.
11. Game Text: The special abilities unique to this 
particular card. Some cards have italicized flavor text, 
featuring quotations from The Lord of the Rings novels.
12. Card Type: Indicates whether this card is a hero, 
ally, attachment, or event.
13. Set Information: Every card has an icon denoting 
the set it belongs to, as well as a unique identification 
number within the set.
Character  Cards
Sometimes, game or rules text will refer to “character” 
cards. Both heroes and allies are considered to be 
“characters.” Card text that says “choose a character” 
allows a player to choose either a hero or an ally card 
as the target of the effect.

---

## Page 9

The Player Deck
The player deck includes a combination of ally, 
attachment, and event cards shuffled into a deck from 
which a player draws his cards throughout the game. 
No more than three copies of any ally, attachment, or 
event card, by title, can be included in a player’s deck. 
Each of the four 30-card starter decks in this core set 
can be played out of the box as an introduction to the 
game. For advanced play, the cards in these starter 
decks can be combined with one another, or further 
developed with cards from Adventure Pack expansions, 
to create 50-card tournament decks. (For more on the 
art of customizing a player deck, see “Tournament 
Deckbuilding and Customization,” page 27.)
Attachment Cards
Attachment cards represent weapons, armor, artifacts, 
equipment, skills, and conditions. When played, they 
are always attached to (placed slightly under) another 
card, and they tend to modify or influence the activity 
of the card to which they are attached. If the card 
to which an attachment is attached leaves play, the 
attachment card is discarded.
Ally Cards
Ally cards represent characters (friends, followers, 
creatures, and hirelings) that assist a player’s heroes on 
the quest. Ally cards are played from a player’s hand, 
and they remain in play until they are destroyed or 
removed from play by a card effect.
Event Cards
Event cards represent maneuvers, actions, tactics, 
spells, and other instantaneous effects at a player’s 
disposal. An event card is played from a player’s hand, 
its text effects are resolved, and the card is then placed 
in its owner’s discard pile.

For the First Game
For the first game, each player chooses one of the four 
spheres of influence and uses the starter deck for that 
sphere. The card numbers of each of the four spheres 
are listed below. Each sphere is also listed with the 
three heroes that should be used with that starter deck.
Leadership (cards 13-27; heroes Aragorn, Glóin, 
Théodred)
Tactics (cards 28-42; heroes Legolas, Gimli, Thalin)
Spirit (cards 43-57; heroes Éowyn, Dunhere, Eleanor)
Lore (cards 58-72; heroes Glorfindel, Denethor, 
Beravor)
Each starter deck should also include 1 copy of the 
neutral ally card, Gandalf (card 73).
Next, the players select a scenario they would like to 
play. For the first game, players should try the “Passage 
Through Mirkwood” scenario, which was designed as 
an introductory scenario. Separate the cards for this 
scenario (see page 26). These consist of the quest cards 
(numbered 120-123), and the encounter cards marked 
with the Passage Through Mirkwood, Spiders of 
Mirkwood, and Dol Guldur Orcs symbols (see  
page 26).
For tournament deckbuilding rules, see page 27.
Playing the Game
Setup
Before playing The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, 
follow these quick steps in order.
1. Shuffle Decks
As with a deck of playing cards, shuffle all player 
decks and the encounter deck separately until they are 
randomized. Do not shuffle the quest cards into the 
encounter deck, and do not shuffle the hero cards into 
the player decks.
2. Place Heroes and Set Initial Threat Levels
Each player places his heroes in front of him, adds 
up the threat cost of the heroes he controls, and sets 
his threat tracker at the same value. This value is that 
player’s starting threat level for the game.
3. Setup Token Bank
Place the damage tokens, progress tokens, and resource 
tokens in a pile next to the encounter deck. All players 
take tokens from this bank as needed throughout  
the game.
4. Determine First Player
The players determine a 
first  player  based on a 
majority group decision. If this proves impossible, 
determine a first player at random. Once determined, 
the first player takes the first player token and places it 
in front of him as reference.
5. Draw Setup Hand
Each player draws 6 cards from the top of his player 
deck. If a player does not wish to keep his starting 
hand, he may take a single 
mulligan , by shuffling 
these 6 cards back into his deck and drawing 6 new 
cards. A player who takes a mulligan must keep his 
second hand.
6. Set Quest Cards
Arrange the quest cards in sequential order, based off 
the numbers on the back of each card. Stage 1A should 
be on top, with the numbers increasing in sequence 
moving down the stack. Place the quest deck near the 
encounter deck, in the center of the play area.
7. Follow Scenario Setup Instruction
The back of the first quest card sometimes provides 
setup instructions for a scenario. Follow these 
instructions before flipping the quest card.
Players then begin the game starting with the first  
game round.
The Staging Area
The staging area is a unique element of the game’s 
playing field. It represents the potential dangers the 
players might face as they progress on their quest.
During the quest phase, enemy and location cards are 
revealed from the encounter deck and placed in the 
staging area. Cards in the staging area are imminent 
threats to the players, including enemies that need to 
be defeated and locations that need to be explored. 
While a location is in the staging area, the players are 
not considered at that location; instead it represents a 
distant threat. Players have the option of traveling to a 
location during the travel phase. Similarly, enemies in 
the staging area are not yet engaged with any of the 
players. Enemies engage players when a player’s threat 
level is high enough to draw out that enemy. Players 
also have the option to voluntarily engage enemies 
during the encounter phase. (For more on engaging 
enemies and traveling to locations, see pages 15-16).
Discard Piles
Each player has his own discard pile, and the encounter 
deck also has its own discard pile. Whenever a card is 
discarded, it goes to the discard pile belonging to the 
card’s originating deck.

Round Sequence
The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is played over a 
series of rounds . Each round is divided into 7 phases . 
Some phases are played simultaneously by all players, 
while in other phases the players act separately, 
with the first player acting first and play proceeding 
clockwise around the table.
The 7 phases are, in order:
1. Resource
2. Planning
3. Quest
4. Travel
5. Encounter
6. Combat
7. Refresh
Once all 7 phases are complete, the round is over, and 
play proceeds to the resource phase of the next round. 
A turn sequence diagram of all the phases, and the 
game events that occur during each phase, can be found 
on pages 30-31 of this rulebook.
Phase 1: Resource
Each player simultaneously adds 1 resource token to 
each of his heroes’ 
resource  pools . A resource pool is 
a collection of resource tokens stored near a hero card. 
These tokens belong to that hero’s pool, and can be 
used to pay for cards that belong to that hero’s sphere 
of influence. Each hero has 1 resource pool. 
After collecting resources, each player draws 1 card 
from his player deck and adds it to his hand. 
When a player is instructed to draw one or more 
cards, he always draws those cards from the top of his 
own player deck. If a player has no cards remaining in 
his player deck, he does not draw.
Phase 2: Planning
This is the only phase in which a player can play  ally 
and attachment cards from his hand. The first player 
plays any and all ally and attachment cards he wishes to 
play first. The opportunity to play cards then proceeds 
clockwise around the table.
In order for a player to play a card from his hand (or 
to activate certain card effects), he must pay for it by 
spending resource tokens from the resource pool of a 
hero who has a resource icon that matches the card’s 
sphere of influence. This is called a 
resource  match . 
Resources that are spent to pay for cards or card effects 
are taken from their hero’s resource pool and placed in 
the general token bank. 
If a hero is exhausted (see page 14), resources may still 
be spent from that hero’s resource pool.
Cards with a cost of zero do not require a resource to be 
spent in order to pay their cost, but they do require 
at least one hero under that player’s control to have a 
resource icon that matches the card’s sphere.
After a player plays an ally or attachment card from 
his hand, he places it faceup and ready in his play 
area. Attachment cards should be placed partially 
overlapping, either above or below, the card to which 
they are attached.
If a player has multiple heroes with similar resource 
icons, he may use resources from multiple pools of the 
same sphere to pay for a single card or effect.
Example: Tom has 3 heroes: Glóin (who has 
a Leadership resource icon and 3 resources 
in his pool), Éowyn (who has a Spirit 
resource icon and 2 resources in her pool), 
and Eleanor (who has a Spirit resource icon 
and 2 resources in her pool). Tom wishes to 
play the Guard of the Citadel card from his 
hand. The Guard of the Citadel belongs to 
the Leadership sphere, so Tom must spend 
resources from Glóin’ s pool to play this card. 
Since the Guard of the Citadel has a cost of 
2, Tom moves 2 resources from Glóin’ s pool 
to the token bank and places the Guard of the 
Citadel into his play area. Tom also wishes to 
play the Northern Tracker card from his hand, 
which belongs to the sphere of Spirit, and 
has a cost of 4. To play this card, Tom takes 2 
resources from Éowyn’ s pool, and 2 resources 
from Eleanor’ s pool, for a total of 4. He can 
do this because both Éowyn and Eleanor have 
Spirit resource icons. Tom spends these tokens 
and places them in the token bank, and then 
places the Northern Tracker in his play area. 
(See diagram on page 13.)
Paying for Neutral Cards
Neutral	cards,	which	belong	to	no	sphere	of	influence,	
require	no	resource	match	to	play.	This	means	that	they	
can	be	payed	for	with	resources	from	any	hero’s	pool.	
Also,	when	paying	for	a	neutral	card,	a	player	may	
combine	resources	from	heroes	with	different	resource	
icons.	Gandalf	is	the	only	neutral	card	in	the	core	set.
Paying for Card Abilities
Some cards have abilities that can be triggered  from 
play, but still require the triggering player to pay 
resources. Triggering a card ability from a card already 
in play requires no resource match, unless otherwise 
specified by the ability.

---

## Page 13

Example: Paying for Cards
1. Glóin has a Leadership resource icon and 3 resource tokens in his resource 
pool. Éowyn and Eleanor each have a Spirit resource icon, and 2 resource tokens 
in their resource pools.
2. To play the Guard of the Citadel from his hand, Tom spends 2 resource tokens 
from Glóin’s pool, returning the tokens to the token bank. 1 resource token 
remains unspent in Glóin’s resource pool.
3. To play the Northern Tracker from his hand, Tom spends 2 resource tokens 
from Éowyn’s resource pool and he spends 2 resource tokens from Eleanor’s 
resource pool, returning the tokens to the token bank.

Ready and Exhausted
Characters and attachment cards enter the game in the 
“ready” position–that is, faceup on the playing surface 
in front of their controller.
When a card has been “used” for some purpose, such 
as to commit to a quest, to attack, to defend, or to use 
a character ability that requires the card to exhaust, 
it is turned 90 degrees sideways and considered 
“exhausted.” An exhausted card cannot exhaust again 
(and therefore cannot partake in any action that  
requires exhaustion) until it has been readied once 
more. When a player is instructed by the game or by 
a card effect to ready a card, he moves that card to its 
normal upright position.
Phase 3: Quest
In the quest phase, the players attempt to make progress 
on the current stage of their quest. This phase is broken 
into three steps: 1) commit characters, 2) staging, and 
3) quest resolution. Players have the opportunity to take 
actions and play event cards at the end of each step.
Step 1: Commit Characters
Each player may commit characters to the current quest 
card. Characters are exhausted when they commit to 
a quest. Players commit characters to the quest as a 
team, starting with the first player, and then proceeding 
clockwise around the table. Each player may commit as 
many of his characters to the quest as he would like.
Step 2: Staging
After each player has had the opportunity to commit 
characters to the quest, the encounter deck reveals 
one card per player. This is known in the game as 
staging . These encounter cards are revealed one at a 
time, with any “when revealed” effects being resolved 
before the next card is revealed. Enemy and location 
cards revealed in this manner are placed in the staging 
area, treachery cards are resolved and (unless otherwise 
indicated by the card text) placed in the discard pile. 
If the encounter deck is ever empty during the quest 
phase, the encounter discard pile is shuffled and reset 
back into the encounter deck.
Step 3: Quest Resolution
Finally, the players compare the combined willpower 
strength ((Willpower)) of all committed characters against the 
combined threat strength ((Threat)) of all cards in the staging 
area. 
If the (Willpower) is higher, the players have successfully 
quested, and they make progress on the quest. A 
number of progress tokens equal to the amount by 
which their (Willpower) overcame the (Threat) are placed on the 
current quest card. Note that if there is an active 
location (see page 15), progress tokens are placed on 
that location until it is explored, and the remainder are 
then placed on the current quest.
If the (Threat) is higher, the players have unsuccessfully 
quested, and they are driven back by the encounter 
deck. Each player must raise his threat dial by the 
amount by which the (Threat) was higher than the combined 
(Willpower) of all committed characters. 
If the combined committed (Willpower) score is equal to the 
combined (Threat) score in the staging area: no progress 
tokens are placed, and the players do not increase their  
threat dials.
Characters committed to a quest are considered 
committed to that quest through the end of the quest 
phase, unless removed from the quest by a card effect. 
They do remain exhausted once this step is complete.
Ready Exhausted

Example: Tom commits Éowyn (4 (Willpower)), and 
Kris commits both Aragorn (2 (Willpower)) and a 
Guard of the Citadel (1 (Willpower)) to the current 
quest. A Gladden Fields location card (3 (Threat)) 
is in the staging area. After all players have 
committed their characters, the encounter 
deck reveals 1 card per player: an East Bight 
Patrol (3 (Threat)) and a Hummerhorns (1 (Threat)). The 
players have a combined (Willpower) of 7, and the quest 
deck has a combined (Threat) of 7. As it stands, this 
quest attempt will end in a draw. However, 
Tom decides to use Éowyn’ s ability, which 
allows him to discard 1 card from his hand 
to increase her (Willpower) by 1, taking the player’ s 
combined committed (Willpower) to 8, so the players 
place 1 progress token on the current  
quest card. (See diagram above.)
Phase 4: Travel
During the travel phase, the players may tra vel  as a 
group to any one location in the staging area by moving 
it from the staging area and placing it alongside the 
current quest card, causing it to become the 
active  
location. The players can only travel to one location 
at a time. The first player makes the final decision on 
whether and where to travel.
While in the staging area, location cards add to the 
encounter deck’s (Threat). Once the players have traveled 
to a location, that location no longer contributes its 
(Threat), as the players are considered to have traveled to the 
location and are confronting its threat. 
Instead, an active location acts as a buffer for the 
currently revealed quest card. Any progress tokens 
that would be placed on a quest card are instead placed 
on the active location. If a location ever has as many 
progress tokens as it has quest points, that location is 
considered 
explored  and is discarded from play.
Players cannot travel to a new location if another 
location card is active; the players must explore the 
active location before traveling elsewhere. Some 
locations have a travel effect, which is an additional 
cost that must be payed when the players travel there 
(see “Travel Effects,” page 23).
Example: Tom and Kris have just scored 3 
progress tokens against the current quest card. 
The Enchanted Stream location, which has 
2 quest points, is active. 2 progress tokens 
are placed on the Enchanted Stream card, 
discarding it from play. The other progress 
token is then placed on the current quest card.
Example: Resolving a Quest
1. Tom exhausts Éowyn to commit her to the quest. Kris exhausts both Aragorn and the Guard of the 
Citadel to commit them to the quest. A Gladden Fields location card is already in the staging area.
2. The players reveal 1 card per player from the encounter deck, and add them to the staging area.
3. The players add up the total committed (Willpower) and compare it to the total (Threat) in the staging area. This 
results in a 7	(Willpower)	to	7	(Threat)	stalemate.	Tom	uses	Éowyn's	card	ability	to	give	the	players	an	additional	
point	of	(Willpower),	which	allows	them	to	place	1	progress	token	on	the	current	quest	card.

Phase 5: Encounter
The encounter phase consists of two steps: player 
engagement, and engagement checks. 
Step 1: Player Engagement
First, each player has the option to engage one enemy 
in the staging area. This is done by moving the enemy 
from the staging area and placing it in front of the 
engaging player.
Each player has one chance to optionally engage one 
enemy during this step, and an enemy’s engagement 
cost has no bearing on this procedure.
Step 2: Engagement Checks
Second, the players must make a series of engagement 
checks, to see if any of the enemies remaining in the 
staging area engage them. The first player compares his 
threat level against the engagement cost of each of the 
enemy cards in the staging area. The enemy with the 
highest engagement cost that is equal to or lower than 
this player’s threat level engages this player, and moves 
from the staging area to the space in front of him. This 
is called making an 
engagement  check . After the first 
player makes an engagement check, the player to his 
left makes his own engagement check. This player 
compares his threat level against the engagement 
cost of each of the remaining enemy cards in the 
staging area, and engages the enemy with the highest 
engagement cost that is equal to or lower than his own 
threat level.
This process continues through all the players, 
proceeding clockwise around the table. Once all players 
have made an engagement check, the first player makes 
a second engagement check. Players continue making 
engagement checks in this manner until there are no 
enemies remaining in the staging area that can engage 
any of the players.
Whether an enemy is engaged through an engagement 
check, through a card effect, or through a player’s 
choice, the end result is the same, with the enemy 
and the player engaging one another. In all cases, the 
player is considered to have engaged the enemy and the 
enemy is considered to have engaged the player.
Note that during this phase enemies do not attack 
players, they merely engage players. Enemies attack 
the players with whom they are engaged during the 
combat phase (see page 18).
 
Example: The first player, Tom, has a threat 
level of 24. The second player, Kris, has a 
threat level of 35. There are 4 enemies in the 
staging area: a King Spider (engagement cost 
of 20), a Forest Spider (engagement cost of 
25), Ungoliant’ s Spawn (engagement cost of 
32), and Hummerhorns (engagement cost of 
40). 
Tom and Kris both pass during the player 
engagement step, declining their opportunity 
to optionally engage enemies. 
Since he is the first player, Tom makes the first 
engagement check. Tom’ s threat level of 24 is 
compared against each enemy in the staging 
area. The Hummerhorns (40), Ungoliant’ s 
Spawn (32), and the Forest Spider (25) each 
have an engagement cost that is higher than 
Tom’ s threat level, so none of these enemies 
engage Tom. The King Spider (20), however, 
has an engagement cost that is equal to or 
lower than Tom’ s threat level, so the King 
Spider engages Tom. This card is moved out of 
the staging area and placed in front of Tom’ s 
play area. 
Next, Kris makes an engagement check, 
comparing his threat level of 34 against 
the remaining enemies in the staging area. 
The Hummerhorns (40) do not engage Kris. 
Ungoliant’ s Spawn, with an engagement cost 
of 32, is the enemy with the highest cost that 
is equal to or below Kris's threat level, so this 
card engages Kris. 
Tom then makes another engagement check, 
and since his threat level and the enemies 
in the staging area have not changed, no 
further enemies engage him. Kris makes 
another engagement check, and this time the 
Forest Spider (25) engages him. Tom’ s next 
engagement check passes, and then Kris 
makes a final engagement check, in which 
nothing engages him. 
The end result, then, leaves Tom engaged with 
the King Spider and Kris engaged with both 
Ungoliant’ s Spawn and the Forest Spider. The 
Hummerhorns remain in the staging area. (See 
diagram on page 17.)

---

## Page 17

Example: Making Engagement Checks
1. The first player, Tom, makes the first 
engagement check. The King Spider has the 
highest engagement cost (20) that is equal to or 
lower than Tom's threat level of 24, so the King 
Spider engages Tom.
2. Kris makes the next engagement check. 
Ungoliant's Spawn has the highest engagement 
cost (32) that is equal to or lower than Kris's threat 
level of 35, so Ungoliant's Spawn engages Kris.
3. Tom makes the next engagement check. His 
threat level is lower than the engagement cost 
of the enemies remaining in the staging area, so 
neither of those enemies engage Tom.
4. Kris makes the next engagement check. The 
Forest Spider has the highest engagement cost (25) 
that is equal to or lower than Kris's threat level of 
35, so the Forest Spider engages Kris.
5. Tom, and then Kris, each make another 
engagement check. The Hummerhorns' 
engagement cost is higher than each of their 
threat levels, so it remains in the staging area at 
this time. Since all players have made successive 
engagement checks without being engaged by any 
enemies, the "engagement checks" step is now 
complete.

Phase 6: Combat
In the combat phase, enemies attack first. All enemies 
that are engaged with the players attack each round, 
and the players resolve those attacks one at a time.
At the beginning of the combat phase, the players deal 

shadow  card to each engaged enemy. Deal the top 
card of the encounter deck, face down, to each engaged 
enemy. When dealing cards to a single player’s 
enemies, always deal to the enemy with the highest 
engagement cost first. Cards should first be dealt to the 
enemies attacking the first player, and then proceed 
around the board until all enemies have 1 card.
If the encounter deck runs out of cards, any enemies 
that have not been dealt shadow cards are not dealt 
shadow cards this round. An empty encounter deck 
only resets during the quest phase (see page 14).
Resolving Enemy Attacks
When resolving enemy attacks, the players follow these 
4 steps, in order. Players may play event cards and take 
actions at the end of each step.
1. Choose an enemy. The first player chooses which 
attack (among the enemies to which he is engaged) to 
resolve first.
2. Declare defender.  A character must exhaust to 
be declared as a defender. Only one character can 
be  declared as a defender against each attacking 
enemy. A player also has the option to let an attack go 
undefended , and declare no defenders for that attack. 
Unless a card effect specifies otherwise, players can 
only declare defenders against enemies with whom 
they are engaged.
3. Resolve shadow effect. The active player flips that 
enemy’s shadow card faceup and resolves any shadow 
effect that card might have.
4. Determine combat damage. This is done by 
subtracting the defense strength ((Defense)) of the defending 
character from the attack strength ((Attack)) of the attacking 
enemy. The remaining value is the amount of damage 
that must immediately be dealt to the defending 
character, possibly destroying that character (see 
“Hit Points and Damage,” page 20).  If a character 
is destroyed by an attack, additional damage is not 
assigned to another character.  If the (Defense) is equal to or 
higher than the (Attack), no damage is dealt.
If an attack is undefended, all damage from the 
attack must be assigned to a single hero controlled 
by the active player. Allies cannot take damage from 
undefended attacks. If a defending character leaves 
play or is removed from combat before damage is 
assigned, the attack is considered undefended. A 
character’s (Defense) does not absorb damage from undefended 
attacks or from card effects.
Example: Kris is engaged with 2 enemies, 
the Forest Spider and Ungoliant’ s Spawn. 
One card from the encounter deck is dealt 
face down to each engaged enemy, first to 
Ungoliant’ s Spawn and second to the Forest 
Spider, as Ungoliant’ s Spawn has a higher 
engagement cost. These cards determine any 
shadow effects that might affect the resolution 
of the attack. Kris can resolve the attacks 
against him in any order; he decides to resolve 
the attack made by Ungoliant’ s Spawn first.
Kris first declares a defender for this attack. 
Kris exhausts his Silverlode Archer, declaring 
it as a defender against Ungoliant’ s Spawn. To 
resolve this attack, Kris flips the shadow card 
that was dealt to Ungoliant’ s Spawn faceup. 
The card is the East Bight Patrol, which has 
the shadow effect “Shadow: Attacking enemy 
gets +1 (Attack). (If this attack was undefended, 
also raise your threat by 3.)” Kris resolves 
this shadow effect first, increasing Ungoliant’ s 
Spawn’ s (Attack) by 1. He then determines the 
attacking enemy’ s total (Attack) (6) and subtracts 
the defender’ s (Defense) (0), and the result is the 
number of damage tokens he must deal to the 
defender (6). Since the Silverlode Archer only 
has 1 hit point, it is immediately destroyed. 
Kris now resolves the other attack being 
made against him. He declares this attack 
undefended. He flips the shadow card that 
was dealt to the Forest Spider faceup. This 
card is the Enchanted Stream, which does 
not have a shadow effect. The attack resolves 
normally, with no additional modifications or 
effects. Kris determines the attacking enemy’ s 
total (Attack) (2), and since there is no defender, 
he must deal this much damage to one of his 
heroes. Kris’ s only hero is Aragorn, who has 
5 hit points. Kris places 2 damage tokens on 
Aragorn, who survives the attack with 3 hit 
points remaining. (See diagram on page 19.)
The first player then repeats these 4 steps for each 
enemy that he is engaged with. After the first player has 
resolved all enemy attacks against himself, the player 
to his left resolves the attacks his enemies are making 
against him, following steps 1-4 in turn for each enemy. 
If playing with more than 2 players, proceed clockwise 
around the table with each player resolving all of his 
enemies’ attacks.
Characters that are declared as defenders are only 
considered to be defending through the resolution of 
the attack. Once an attack has resolved, the characters 
are no longer considered “defenders,” but they do 
remain exhausted.

## Page 19

Example: Defending Against Enemy Attacks
1. Kris is engaged with 2 enemies, the Forest 
Spider and Ungoliant's Spawn. At the beginning of 
the combat phase, 1 card from the encounter deck 
is dealt face down to each engaged enemy, as a 
shadow card.
2. Kris decides to resolve the attack made by 
Ungoliant's Spawn first. He exhausts the Silverlode 
Archer, declaring it as a defender against this 
attack.
3. To resolve the attack, Kris first flips the 
attacker's shadow card faceup. The shadow card 
is the East Bight Patrol, which gives the attacking 
enemy +1 (Attack). Kris compares the enemy's total 
attack (6 (Attack)) against the Silverlode Archer's 
defense (0 (Defense)), and places 6 damage tokens on the 
defending character. Since the Silverlode Archer 
only has 1 hit point, it is destroyed and discarded 
from play.
4. Next, Kris resolves the attack made by the East 
Bight Patrol. He declares this attack "undefended."
5. To resolve the attack, Kris first flips the 
attacker's shadow card faceup. The shadow card is 
the Enchanted Stream, which has no shadow effect. 
The Forest Spider's attack is 2 (Attack). Since this attack 
was undefended, Kris must place all the damage 
on a single hero he controls. He places 2 damage 
tokens on Aragorn, who survives the attack with 3 
hit points remaining.

## Page 20

Attacking Enemies
Once all players have resolved enemy attacks, each 
player (starting with the first player and proceeding 
clockwise) has the opportunity to strike back and 
declare attacks against his enemies.
In order to declare an attack, a player must exhaust at 
least 1 ready character. A character must exhaust to be 
declared as an attacker. When declaring an attack, a 
player must also declare which enemy is the target of 
the attack. A player may declare multiple characters 
as attackers against a single enemy, pooling their 
attack strength into a single value.  A player has the 
opportunity to declare 1 attack against each enemy with 
which he is engaged.
To resolve an attack against an enemy, a player follows 
these 3 steps, in order. Players may play event cards 
and take actions at the end of each step.
1. Declare target of attack, and declare attackers. 
A player does this by choosing 1 enemy with whom 
he is currently engaged, and exhausting any number of 
characters as attackers.
2. Determine attack strength. Add up the total attack 
strength ((Attack)) of the attacking characters that have been 
declared against that target.
3. Determine combat damage. This is done by 
subtracting the target enemy’s defense strength ((Defense)) 
from the combined (Attack) of all the attacking characters. 
The remaining value is the amount of damage that is 
immediately dealt to the target. If the (Defense) is equal to or 
higher than the (Attack), no damage is dealt.
Characters that are declared as attackers are only 
considered to be attacking through the resolution of the 
attack. Once an attack has resolved, the characters are 
no longer considered “attackers,” but they do remain 
exhausted.
After a player’s first attack has resolved, he can declare 
another attack against any eligible enemy target that he 
has not yet attacked this round. Each player can declare 
an attack (with any number of eligible attackers he 
controls) against each enemy with which he is engaged 
once each round. Once all of a player’s attacks resolve, 
play proceeds clockwise from the first player until all 
players have resolved all of their attacks.
Shadow Cards Leaving Play
Shadow cards remain on the enemy to which they were 
dealt throughout the combat phase. If that enemy leaves 
play, discard its shadow card from play. At the end of 
the combat phase, discard all shadow cards that were 
dealt this round.
Example: Tom is engaged with two enemies, 
the Dol Guldur Beastmaster and the Dol 
Guldur Orcs. He can declare one attack 
against each of these enemies this round, but 
he must declare and resolve these attacks one 
at a time. 
Tom declares his first attack against the Dol 
Guldur Orcs, and exhausts Glorfindel to 
declare him as an attacker. Tom determines 
Glorfindel’ s (Attack) (3) and then subtracts from it 
the Dol Guldur Orcs' (Defense) (0), and gets a result 
of 3. Tom places 3 damage tokens from the 
token bank on the Dol Guldur Orcs. Since the 
Dol Guldur Orcs only have 3 hit points, they 
are destroyed, and the Dol Guldur Orcs card 
is placed in the encounter discard pile.
Next, Tom declares Legolas and the 
Gondorian Spearman as attackers against the 
Dol Guldur Beastmaster. Legolas (3 (Attack)) and 
the Gondorian Spearman (1 (Attack)) pool their 
attack strength together, for a total (Attack) of 4. 
The Dol Guldur Beastmaster has a (Defense) of 1, so 
3 points of the attack are dealt as damage. 
Tom places 3 damage tokens from the token 
bank on the Dol Guldur Beastmaster. Since 
this enemy started with 5 hit points, it survives 
the attack with 2 hit points remaining. The 
damage tokens remain on the Dol Guldur 
Beastmaster to indicate that it is damaged. 
(See diagram on page 21.)
Hit Points and Damage
For each point of damage dealt to a character or enemy, 
one damage token is placed on the character or enemy 
card. Each damage token on a hero, ally, or enemy 
card reduces that card’s hit points by 1. Damage tokens 
remain on a card until another effect heals or moves the 
damage off of the card, or until the card leaves play. 
Any time one of these cards has 0 hit points, it is 
immediately defeated. Defeated characters are placed 
in their owner’s discard pile, and defeated enemies are 
placed in the encounter discard pile. Note that hero 
cards that are defeated are placed in their owner’s 
discard pile. When resolving effects that move cards 
from a player’s discard pile to his hand or deck, hero 
cards in the discard pile are ignored, as hero cards 
cannot move to a player’s hand or deck.
Any enemy cards that are not defeated remain engaged 
with a player until they are defeated or removed by a 
card effect, or until that player is eliminated from the 
game (see “Player Elimination,” page 22).

## Page 21

Example: Attacking Enemies
Tom is engaged with 2 enemies, the Dol Guldur 
Beastmaster and the Dol Guldur Orcs.
1. Tom first declares an attack against the Dol 
Guldur Orcs, and exhausts Glorfindel as an 
attacker.
2. Tom takes Glorfindel's attack (3 (Attack)) and 
subtracts the Dol Guldur Orcs' defense (0 (Defense)), and 
gets a result of 3. Tom places 3 damage tokens 
from the token bank on the Dol Guldur Orcs. This 
enemy started with 3 hit points, so it is destroyed 
and discarded from play.
3.Tom next declares an attack against the Dol 
Guldur Beastmaster, and exhausts both Legolas 
(3 (Attack)) and the Gondorian Spearman (1 (Attack)) as 
attackers. 
4. Tom takes his combined attack (4 (Attack)) and 
subtracts the Dol Guldur Beastmaster's' defense 
(1 (Defense)), and gets a result of 3. Tom places 3 damage 
tokens from the token bank on the Dol Guldur 
Beastmaster. This enemy started with 5 hit 
points, so it survives the attack with 2 hit points 
remaining. The damage tokens stay on the enemy 
to indicate that it is damaged.

## Page 22

Phase 7: Refresh
During the refresh phase, all exhausted cards ready, 
each player increases his threat by 1, and the first 
player passes the first player token to the next player 
clockwise on his left. That player becomes the new first 
player. Play then proceeds to the resource phase of the 
next round.
Ending the Game
The game ends in one of two ways, with the players 
either winning or losing as a team. The players are 
considered to have lost if all players are eliminated 
before the completion of the final stage of the scenario 
deck. The players are considered to have won if at least 
one player survives through the completion of the final 
stage of the scenario.
Player Elimination
A player is eliminated from the game if all of his 
heroes are killed, if his threat level reaches 50, or if a 
card effect forces his elimination. (Future expansion 
scenarios may have threat elimination levels at values 
other than 50; for all of the scenarios included in the 
core set, a player is eliminated when his threat level 
reaches 50.)
When a player is eliminated, his hand, all of the cards 
he controls, and his deck are placed in their owners’ 
discard piles. Any encounter cards with which that 
player was engaged are returned to the staging area, 
retaining any wound tokens that have been placed on 
them. The remaining players continue to play the game. 
Note that after a player is eliminated, one less card is 
revealed from the encounter deck during the staging 
step of the quest phase, as there is now one less player 
involved in the game. 
If all players are eliminated, the game ends in a loss 
for the players.
Quest Advancement
Players immediately advance to the next stage of a 
quest as soon as they place a number of progress tokens 
equal to or greater than the number of quest points 
the current quest card has. Additional progress tokens 
earned against the quest do not carry over to the next 
stage. All progress tokens on the quest are returned to 
the token bank when players advance to the next stage. 
Players follow any instructions on the newly revealed 
quest card as it is revealed. 
The game state of other cards does not change; cards 
in the staging area remain in the staging area, cards 
engaged with players remain engaged, exhausted 
characters remain exhausted, damage tokens and 
resources remain as they are placed, and the round 
sequence is not interrupted.
Winning the Game
If at least one player survives through the 
completion of the final stage of the scenario, the 
game ends in a victory for the players.
Scoring
If the players win the game, use this process to 
determine their group's score for the game. A 
group's score is determined by adding together three 
undesirable elements (the final threat level of each 
player, the threat penalty on all dead heroes, and the 
number of damage tokens on all surviving heroes), 
and then subtracting any victory points that have been 
collected. Players collect victory points by defeating 
enemies and exploring locations that grant victory 
points (see page 24). 
When a player is eliminated, his threat is considered to 
be 50, and all of his heroes are considered dead. Note 
that an eliminated player’s threat does not, however,  
increase beyond his threat elimination level (50,  
unless otherwise specified by the quest rules or by a 
card effect). 
With this scoring system, a victory with a low score is 
more desirable than a victory with a high score, and it 
is even possible, if the players do remarkably well, to 
achieve a negative score on a quest.  
Scoring is a useful tool in evaluating the performance 
of a deck or a party over time, or in comparing one 
deck or group of decks to another. This enables 
players to play the same scenario multiple times with 
different hero and deck combinations, evaluating their 
effectiveness in each game. A scoresheet is provided on 
the back cover of this rulebook.
Example: Tom, playing a solo game, has 
defeated the “Passage Through Mirkwood” 
quest, with a threat level of 43, one dead 
hero (with a threat cost of 8), 6 damage on 
his remaining heroes, and 5 victory points. 
His final score is calculated in the following 
manner:
   Final Threat Level (43) 
+ Threat Cost of Each Dead Hero (8) 
+ Damage Tokens on Heroes (6) 
– Number of Victory Points Earned (5) 
 
            Tom’s Final Score (52)

Advanced Concepts
This section details some of the more advanced 
concepts players might encounter as they delve deeper 
into the The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game.
Card Effects
There are several kinds of card effects in The Lord of 
the Rings: The Card Game. On the hero and player 
cards, card effects fall into one of 5 categories: 
constant effects, actions, responses, forced effects, 
and keywords. On the cards found in the quest 
and encounter decks, card effects fall into one of 
6 categories: constant effects, forced effects, when 
revealed effects, shadow effects, travel effects, and 
keywords. Each of these card effect types is explained 
below.
Constant Effects
Constant effects continually affect the game state as 
long as the card is in play and any other specified 
conditions are met. These effects have no bold trigger, 
as they are always active.
The location card Enchanted Stream provides an 
example of a constant effect.
Actions
Actions are denoted by a bold “Action:” trigger on a 
card. Actions are always optional, and can be triggered 
by their controller during any action window in the 
game sequence. In order to trigger an action on a hero, 
ally, or attachment card, the card on which the action 
is printed must be in play, unless the action specifies 
that it can be triggered from an out of play state. 
Event cards are actions that are played directly from a 
player’s hand.
Some action triggers are preceded by a specific 
phase of the game. This type of trigger means that 
the following action can only be triggered during the 
specified phase. For example, an effect with the trigger 
“Quest Action:” can only be triggered during an action 
window of the quest phase. Actions without a specified 
phase can be triggered during any action window 
throughout the round. (See the “Turn Sequence” chart 
on pages 30-31.)
The hero card Glorfindel provides an example of 
an action that can be used during any player action 
window. The event card Radagast’s Cunning provides 
an example of an action that can only be used during 
the quest phase.
Responses
Responses are denoted by a bold “Response:” trigger 
on a card. Responses are always optional, and can 
be triggered by their controller in response to (i.e. 
immediately after) a specified game occurrence. In 
order to trigger a response on a hero, ally, or attachment 
card, the card on which the response is printed must 
be in play, unless the response specifies that it can be 
triggered from an out of play state. Event cards with 
“Response:” effects are responses that are played from 
a player’s hand.
The ally card Son of Arnor provides an example of 
a response effect that can be triggered (at a player’s 
discretion) whenever its specified trigger (“after Son of 
Arnor enters play”) is met.
Forced and When Revealed Effects
Forced effects are initiated by specific occurrences 
throughout a game, and they occur automatically, 
whether the card’s controller wants them to or not. 
They are denoted by a bold “Forced:” trigger on a 
card. These effects initiate and resolve immediately, 
whenever their specified prerequisite occurs. The 
enemy card Marsh Adder provides an example of 
a forced effect that must be triggered whenever its 
specified trigger (“each time Marsh Adder attacks”) is 
met.
When revealed effects are a special case of forced 
effects, that occur automatically as soon as the 
encounter card is revealed. They are denoted by a bold 
“When Revealed:” trigger on a card. When revealed 
effects do not resolve when the card is revealed as a 
shadow effect.
Shadow Effects
Some of the cards in the encounter deck have a 
secondary effect that is known as a shadow effect. 
These effects are offset from a card’s non-shadow 
game effects by the graphic shown above, and they 
are formatted in italic type. Shadow effects are also 
denoted by a bold and italic “Shadow:” trigger on the 
card. Shadow effects only resolve when the card is 
dealt to an attacking enemy during combat. 
The enemy card Dol Guldur Orcs provides an example 
of a shadow effect that triggers whenever the card is 
dealt to an attacking enemy as a shadow card.
Travel Effects
Some location cards have travel effects, which are 
denoted by a bold “Travel:” trigger on a card. Travel 
effects are costs or restrictions that some or all players 
must pay or meet in order to travel to that location. If 
the players cannot fulfill the requirement of a location’s 
travel effect, the players cannot travel to that location.

Keywords
Keywords are used as shorthand for common 
game effects that appear on a number of cards. The 
keywords and their role in the game are explained 
below. Keywords are denoted textually, usually at the 
beginning of a card’s rules text.
Doomed X
If an encounter card with the doomed keyword is 
revealed during the staging step of the quest phase, 
each player must raise his threat level by the specified 
value.
Guarded
The guarded keyword is a reminder on some objective 
cards to reveal and attach the next card of the encounter 
deck to the objective when it enters the staging area 
from the encounter deck, and place them both in the 
staging area. The objective cannot be claimed as long 
as any encounter card is attached. Once that encounter 
is dealt with, the objective remains in the staging area 
until it is claimed. If another objective card comes up 
while attaching a card for the guarded keyword, place 
the second objective in the staging area, and use the 
next card of the encounter deck to fulfill the original 
keyword effect.
Enemy and location cards attached to guarded 
objectives do still count their threat while the enemy 
or location is in the staging area. An encounter card 
attached to a guarded objective is dealt with in the 
following method, depending on its card type:
Enemy: The enemy leaves play, either by being 
defeated or as the result of a card effect.
Location: The location leaves play, either by being 
fully explored or as the result of a card effect.
Treachery: The treachery’s effects resolve, or are 
canceled. (Treachery cards are immediately triggered 
when they are revealed.)
Once all encounter cards attached to a guarded 
objective are dealt with, the players can claim the 
objective in the manner specified by its card text.
Ranged
A character with the ranged keyword can be declared 
by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are 
engaged with other players. A character can declare 
ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is 
declaring attacks, or it can participate in attacks that are 
declared by other players. In either case, the character 
must exhaust and meet any other requirements 
necessary to make the attack.
Restricted
Some attachments have the restricted keyword. A 
character can never have more than two attachments 
with the restricted keyword attached. If a third 
restricted attachment is ever attached to a character, 
one of the restricted attachments must immediately be 
moved to its owner’s discard pile.
Sentinel
A character with the sentinel keyword can be declared 
by its controller as a defender during enemy attacks 
that are made against other players. A character can 
declare sentinel defense after the player engaged with 
the enemy making the attack declares “no defenders.” 
The defending sentinel character must exhaust and 
meet any other requirements necessary to defend the 
attack.
Surge
When an encounter card with the surge keyword is 
revealed during the staging step of the quest phase, 
reveal 1 additional card from the encounter deck. 
Resolve the surge keyword immediately after resolving 
any when revealed effects on the card.
Victory X
Some enemy and location cards award victory points 
when they are defeated. When such a card leaves play, 
one player should place it near his threat dial to remind 
the players of the victory points when they are scoring 
at the end of the game. It is recommended that one 
player collects all the victory cards the players earn 
during the scenario, as victory points are applied to the 
score of the entire group. (See “Scoring,” page 22.)

Lasting Effects
Many effects last only for the duration of one action 
(immediately after being triggered), but some effects 
last for a set period of time, or even indefinitely. Effects 
that last for longer than a single action are called 
lasting effects.
Multiple lasting effects may affect the same card at 
the same time. The order in which the lasting effects 
take place is irrelevant, since the net sum of all lasting 
effects is applied to the card.
If one of a hero’s, ally’s, enemy’s, or location’s 
statistics ((Attack), (Defense), (Threat), or (Willpower)) is ever lower than 0 after all 
effects are applied, that statistic is rounded up to 0. Any 
time a new effect is applied to a card, the net sum of all 
active effects should be recalculated.
Paying Costs
Many cards are written in a “pay or exhaust X to do 
Y” manner. When confronted with such a construct, 
everything before the word “to” is considered the cost, 
and everything after the word “to” is considered an 
effect.
Costs can only be payed with cards or resources that a 
player controls. If an effect is canceled, the cost is still 
considered to have been paid.
Control and Ownership
A player “owns” his heroes and the cards that he has 
chosen for the player deck he is playing. A player 
“controls” all cards that he owns, unless another player 
or the encounter deck takes control of the card through 
a game effect. Any time a card leaves play, it reverts to 
its owner’s hand, deck, or discard pile (as directed by 
the effect forcing the card out of play).
When a player plays an ally card, it comes into play 
under his control and is placed in his play area. If 
another player takes control of that ally, it is moved to 
the controlling player's play area. Ally cards cannot be 
played under the control of another player, they can 
only change control through card effects.
When a player plays an attachment card, he has the 
option of giving control of that card to another player 
by attaching the card to one of that player’s characters. 
Players always assume control of attachments that 
have been played on their characters. If control of 
that character changes, so does the control of any 
attachments on that character.
In Play  and Out of Play
"In play" refers to cards that have been played or put 
into play (in a player’s play area), to cards that are 
waiting in the staging area, to the currently revealed 
quest card, and to encounter cards that are engaged 
with that player. "Out of play" states are" in a player's 
hand," "in a deck," or "in a discard pile.” Card effects 
do not interact with cards in an out of play state unless 
the effect specifically refers to that state.
Running Out of Cards
If a player runs out of cards in his player deck, he  
continues to play the game with the cards he has in play 
and in his hand. He does not reshuffle his discard pile.
If the encounter deck is ever out of cards during the 
quest phase, the encounter discard pile is shuffled and 
reset back into the encounter deck.
Table Talk
Players are permitted and encouraged to talk to one 
another during play, and to work as a team to plan and 
execute the best course of action. Players can discuss 
anything they would like, but they cannot name or read 
out loud directly from cards in their hand, or from cards 
that they have seen but the rest of the players have not.

Scenario Overview
There are 3 unique scenarios included in this core set. 
Each is introduced, along with a list of encounter sets 
for that scenario’s encounter deck, below.
Passage Through Mirkwood
Difficulty level = 1 
Mirkwood has long been a dangerous place, and 
recently one of King Thranduil’ s patrols has uncovered 
disconcerting signs of a gathering menace in the 
vicinity of Dol Guldur. A party of heroes, controlled by 
the players, has been assembled to carry a message 
through Mirkwood, down the Anduin, and eventually to 
Lórien, to warn Lady Galadriel of the imminent danger.
The Passage Through Mirkwood encounter deck is 
built with all the cards from the following encounter 
sets: Passage Through Mirkwood, Spiders of 
Mirkwood, and Dol Guldur Orcs. These sets are 
indicated by the following icons:
Journey Down the Anduin
Difficulty level = 4  
Having survived the dangers of Mirkwood Forest, 
the heroes continue their journey along the banks of 
the Anduin river, toward Lórien, with dire news of a 
gathering threat in Southern Mirkwood.
The Journey Down the Anduin encounter deck is built 
with all the cards from the following encounter sets: 
Journey Down the Anduin, Sauron’ s Reach, Dol Guldur 
Orcs, and Wilderlands. These sets are indicated by the 
following icons: 
Escape from Dol Guldur
Difficulty level = 7 
While exploring in the vicinity of Dol Guldur at Lady 
Galadriel's request, one of the heroes' companions 
is captured by the Necromancer's forces, and is now 
awaiting interrogation in a dungeon beneath the hill. 
Knowing their friend's time is short, the heroes decide 
to attempt a desperate rescue.
The Escape from Dol Guldur encounter deck is built 
with all the cards from the following encounter sets: 
Escape from Dol Guldur, Spiders of Mirkwood, and 
Dol Guldur Orcs. These sets are indicated by the 
following icons:

Tournament Deckbuilding 
and Customization
Much of the depth and fun of The Lord of the Rings: 
The Card Game comes when players conceive and 
construct original decks, using the cards of this core 
set and those found in Adventure Pack expansions. A 
tournament deck must contain a minimum of 50 cards. 
Additionally, no more than three copies of any card, by 
title, can be included in a player’s deck. Within these 
guidelines any combination of allies, attachments, and 
events can be used in the player deck.
Each player also starts the game with 1-3 heroes. 
Players may confer together before each game to 
select the heroes they would each like to use during 
that game. If more than one player desires to use the 
same hero, they must decide among themselves before 
the game begins, and the other player(s) must choose 
different heroes. In such situations, if the players 
cannot decide who will control a certain hero, a random 
method should be used to determine control of that 
hero.
When building a deck, it is important for a player to 
consider how he intends to pay for the cards he is 
including in his deck. It may be tempting to use the 
most powerful trio of heroes available, but is it worth 
starting the game with the high threat level those heroes 
would bring? Similarly, a deck full of high cost cards 
and effects might look powerful on paper, but the time 
it takes to build up the resources to play those cards 
could become rather problematic as the enemies mount 
their assault. A player should also make sure that all 
the cards in his deck belong to a sphere that matches 
at least one of his heroes’ resource icons, lest he find 
himself with a dead card he cannot hope to play.
Each sphere of influence has a distinct flavor, which 
can be used to a player’s advantage when building a 
deck around that sphere. For instance, a deck could be 
built around the sphere of tactics to support its heroes 
with an impressive array of armor and weaponry, and 
then take the fight directly to the enemies that emerge 
from the encounter deck. As the card pool grows with 
Adventure Pack expansions, each of the four basic 
starter decks in this core set can be developed into fully 
playable tournament decks.
It is also possible to focus on multiple spheres when 
building a deck. A deck built around both the sphere of 
spirit and around the sphere of lore could focus on selfpreservation, with numerous effects that heal hit points 
and reduce threat. The trick to building around multiple 
spheres is resource management; having the right 
type of resource available at the right time becomes 
more difficult when a deck is built around two or three 
different spheres.
Another useful approach when building decks is to 
follow the cohesion that can be discovered by building 
around a trait. For instance, if a player wants to run a 
deck built around three different spheres, it might make 
sense to use Dwarf cards from all three spheres to take 
advantage of Dwarf synergies and card interactions.
Basic Game
Newer players or players who want a more basic 
experience can play and enjoy the game by not 
dealing shadow cards during the combat phase. This 
eliminates an element of surprise that could make the 
game too challenging for a beginner. Once players are 
comfortable with this experience, they can then add the 
shadow effects to make combat less predictable and 
more exciting.
Expert Game
For an expert level challenge, players can attempt 
to defeat all 3 scenarios using the same combination 
of players, decks, and heroes. The score from each 
scenario can then be added together to get a single 
score measuring overall success on the entire 
campaign. For a “nightmare” level challenge, do not 
reset threat, hit points, or player decks at the beginning 
of each scenario. When playing such a campaign, 
the players should start with the “Passage through 
Mirkwood” scenario, follow with the “Journey Down 
the Anduin” scenario, and finish with the “Escape from 
Dol Guldur” scenario.
